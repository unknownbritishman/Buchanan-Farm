        <p class="welcome2">Here you'll learn about the farm.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Buchanan Community Schools is one of just a handful of public K-12 districts in the state of Michigan that has its own farm! The 32-acre school farm currently hosts hands-on learning opportunities for Buchanan Community School students in grades kindergarten through fourth grade. From planting seeds, harvesting pumpkins, tapping maple trees, building scarecrows, and composting, students use real-world applications to not only master Michigan Science Standards but also to learn life skills that can be tapped into during their future years.</p>

        <h3 class="projects">Iconic MI Student Projects 2024</h3>
        <p class="projects2">During the 2023-2024 school year, Buchanan Middle School teachers Erin Kratky and Monica Luke were selected as part of a fellowship with PBS & the Michigan Learning Channel’s Iconic Michigan Teachers. As part of the fellowship, forty of Kratky & Luke’s 7th grade Advisory students learned media literacy and media making from November-May.  The final project of the fellowship was to create a short documentary on an “iconic” aspect of the local area.  It was a unanimous decision to focus on the Buchanan school farm, as it held many iconic memories for many in the Buchanan community.</p>
