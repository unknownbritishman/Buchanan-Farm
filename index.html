            <p>Buchanan Community Schools is one of just a handful of public K-12 districts in the state of Michigan that has its own farm! The 32-acre school farm currently hosts hands-on learning opportunities for Buchanan Community School students in grades kindergarten through fourth grade. From planting seeds, harvesting pumpkins, tapping maple trees, building scarecrows, and composting, students use real-world applications to not only master Michigan Science Standards but also to learn life skills that can be tapped into during their future years.</p>
